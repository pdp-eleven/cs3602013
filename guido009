Some ways to break the system would be the following:
Person uploads the wrong file to send out to the slaves. 
As in the file can not be able to run but fully workable on the other computers.
  For example:
    File to be distributed is a different file format that the other computers can not read.
    File to be distributed is not compatable with the other computers due to architecture X86 vs 64
    File to be distributed can not be compiled on the others due to missing updates on the .net framework.

ORCA: Online Routine Control & Automation - Design Goals

Guido, Malik, Blencowe, Schoonmaker


The foremost goals of our system are design and input agnosticity and statelessness. Barring hardware or operating system malfunctions, the system should always undergo a controlled exit and enter an environment in which it is restartable.

In order to accomplish these goals, the following measures will be taken: 

* The system will always have a finite number of execution paths.

* If at any time an external function call is made which may block execution indefinitely, it is to be called from a separate thread of execution which may be destroyed if it has existed for an unacceptable amount of time. 

* If at any time an action may be taken iteratively, there is always to be a defined maximum number of iterations. 

* Whenever a decision is made, the available branches are always to consist of an exit branch, a repeat branch and a continue branch. 

* Alterations to the permanent storage associated with the execution environment are to be avoided if at all possible, and are to be reversible.

* Returning to a restart capable environment should depend as little as possible explicit reversal of previous alterations made to any associated permanent storage.


Goals that are considered desirable, but are not intrinsic to the basic design of the system are as follows:

ORCA: Online Routine Control & Automation - Design Goals

Guido, Malik, Blencowe, Schoonmaker


The foremost goals of our system design are input agnosticity and statelessness. Barring hardware or operating system malfunctions, the system should always undergo a controlled exit and enter an environment in which it is restartable.

In order to accomplish these goals, the following measures will be taken: 

* The system will always have a finite number of execution paths.

* If at any time an external function call is made which may block execution indefinately, it is to be called from a seperate thread of execution which may be destroyed if it has existed for an unacceptable ammount of time. 

* If at any time an action may be taken iteratively, there is always to be a defined maximum number of iterations. 

* Whenever a decision is made, the available branches are always to consist of an exit branch, a repeat branch and a continue branch.

ORCA: Online Routine Control & Automation - Architecture

Guido, Malik, Blencowe, Schoonmaker


The most general architecture of the system will be layer based. 

Layer 0, Operating System APIs:

This layer consists entirely of datatypes and functions which are defined in libraries that are distributed with the installation target operating system (Microsoft Windows 7). 

* Layer 0 may contain mutable instance data, but its behavior is considered to be considered to be beyond the scope of the program, except where explicitly defined. 

* Layer 0 may span multiple files and namespaces.


Layer 1, The Universl Toolkit: 

The Universal Toolkit consists of functions and datatypes which are defined in the utk:: namespace. These datatypes and functions are generally considered to be  applicable and useful at all stages of execution. 

* Layer 1 contains no mutable instance data of any kind. 

* Layer 1 is responsible for presenting any mutable data instances that exist in layer 0 as being nonmutable in nature, including recording their state and returning them to a recorded state. 

* Layer 1 may span multiple files, but must always be within utk::. 


Layer 2, Megaclasses: 

The Megaclass layer consists of

ORCA: Online Routine Control & Automation - Analysis, User Interaction

Guido, Malik, Blencowe, Schoonmaker

All user interactions are handled through the command line interpreter in use on the installation target or through the GUI module. The GUI module is a direct analog of the capabilities of a reference command line interpreter.

At any point following execution, ORCA may exit due to an error. Any error due to an exit will cause main() to return a non-zero integer to the operating system on the installation target, and an error message to be sent to STDOUT on the local installation target using printf().
